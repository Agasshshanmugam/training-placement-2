# 🚀 *Instructions*

Hello, students! 🙌 This is a step-by-step guide to get you started with our web application for tracking your coding progress. Follow these instructions *strictly* to ensure smooth operation and compliance. 👍

## 📋 *Guidelines for Repository Setup*

1. *Repository Name* 🎯:

   - Every student must name their repository `training-placement-1`
   - This naming convention is *mandatory*. Repositories with other names will not be tracked.

2. *Use the Template Repository* 🌟:

   - Clone the provided template repository to maintain consistency.
   - Repository link: [*Template Repository*](https://github.com/sreena13/github-template)
   - You *must* use this template for all your submissions.

---

## 📅 *Date-wise Submission Schedule*

- The template includes predefined dates. 📆 Adhere to these dates when uploading your code.
- *Example:* If the date in the template is `21.12.2024`, ensure that all code corresponding to that day is submitted on or before this date.

## 🛑 *Strict Rules for File Naming and Extensions*

1. *File Naming* ✍:

   - Files must not have random names like file1.txt. Name them clearly based on their purpose.
   - *Example:* `binary_search.py` for a binary search program.

2. *Extensions* 💻:

   - Use extensions that match the language of the code:
     - `.py` for Python
     - `.java` for Java
     - `.cpp` for C++
     - `.js` for JavaScript
   - **Do not save files with ********************************************************************************************.txt******************************************************************************************** or other random extensions.**
